# photo-caption-generator

This React application is an online photo caption generator for social media posts built for the Fall 2022 Shopify Front End Intern Challenge. It lets users enter topics, themes/genres, nouns, short sentences or even hashtags revolving around their photos and returns captions that would best suit them. 

## How it was Built
The application was built using React and ChakraUI and uses the OpenAI API which provides access to GPT-3. 

## Features
* Input works on themes/genres, nouns, short sentences that describe the context of the photo, and hashtags.
* Displays all generated caption results in a list sorted from newest (top) to oldest (bottom).
* Presets for common photo themes/genres are available for ease of use.
